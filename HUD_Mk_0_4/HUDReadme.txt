This sketch runs with Processing, v2.2.1 is the version I'm using. 

There is a variable called CameraSelection in the top of the program, you will need to change this variable to select which resolution settings and/or camera you want to use. 

This is still a pretty rough version of the code, I'll clean it up as the project goes more and more public. 

All code is released under the MIT license.
